            <h5>About Meerut</h5>
            <p>Meerut was founded as Mayarashtra (lit. Maya's country) by Maya, who was the father of Mandodari,
              Ravana's wife in the Ramayana. Meerut was the capital of Maya. Thus the city is also known as 'Ravan Ka Sasural' literally meaning "Ravana's wife's home".
              In Ramayana, It was known as 'Maydant Ka Kheda', capital of May danav. It was hometown of Mandodari.After the archaeological excavations at Vidura-ka-tila,
               a collection of several mounds named after Vidura, in 1950–52, a site 37 km (23 miles) north-east 
              of Meerut, it was concluded to be remains of the ancient city of Hastinapur, the capital of Kauravas and Pandavas of Mahabharata, which was washed away by Ganges floods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meerut is the 63rd-fastest-growing urban area in the world. It is the 14th fastest developing city  
                in India. A June 2011 report by US financial services firm Morgan Stanley gave Meerut the 5th spot 
                on the "vibrancy" index, ahead of Delhi and Mumbai. Meerut ranked second on both the financial penetration 
                index, which measures things like the presence of ATMs and bank branches, and on the consumption index, 
                indicating the city's transformation into an urban town. While the city ranked in the bottom 10 in job 
                creations, the report suggests that overall there are plenty of signs of "potential for urbanisation," 
                including future employment opportunities.[84] The infrastructure segment of Meerut is currently going 
                through a boom phase with many new projects coming up in and around the city.[85][86] There are many 
                new buildings, shopping complexes, malls, roads, flyovers and apartments coming up. The Upper Ganga 
                Canal Expressway is also under development.[citation needed] On the  
                India City Competitiveness Index, the city ranked 45th in 2010, 37th in 2011 and 39th in 2012.

            <h3>Role of Meerut in 1857 revolt 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Indian Mutiny, also called Sepoy Mutiny or First War of Independence, widespread but 
                unsuccessful rebellion against British rule in India in 1857–59. Begun in Meerut by 
                Indian troops (sepoys) in the service of the British East India Company, it spread
                to Delhi, Agra, Kanpur, and Lucknow.<br/>
                The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in 
                India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned
                 as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10
                May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of 
                Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi (now Old Delhi). It then erupted into other mutinies 
                and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,
                though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.<br/>
                The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only
                 with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted 
                 amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have
                  formally ended until 8 July 1859. Its name is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny,
                 the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.
